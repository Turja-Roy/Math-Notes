\section{Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates}

There are a great many curves out there that cannot be expressed in a single equation in terms of only $x$ and $y$. To deal with such problems, we introduce \textbf{parametric equations}. Instead of defining $y$ in terms of $x (y=f(x))$ or $x$ in terms of $y (x=h(y))$, we define both $x$ and $y$ in terms of a third variable called a parameter as follows:
\[ x = f(t) \quad y = g(t) \]
This third variable is usually denoted by $t$. Each value of $t$ defines a point $(x,y) = (f(t),g(t))$ that we can plot. The collection of points that we get by letting $t$ be all possible values is the graph of the parametric equations and is called a \textbf{parametric curve}.

\subsection{Parametric Equations and Curves}

Unlike graphs of functions $y=f(x)$, parametric curves can trace out shapes that fail the vertical line test. For instance, a circle cannot be written as a single function $y=f(x)$, but can be easily expressed parametrically.

\Example{Sketch the parametric curve $x = t^2$, $y = 2t - 1$ for $-2 \leq t \leq 2$.}{
    We can create a table of values:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        $t$ & $x = t^2$ & $y = 2t-1$ \\ \hline
        $-2$ & $4$ & $-5$ \\
        $-1$ & $1$ & $-3$ \\
        $0$ & $0$ & $-1$ \\
        $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
        $2$ & $4$ & $3$
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Plotting these points $(x,y)$ and connecting them traces out a parabola opening to the right. \\
    To eliminate the parameter, note that $x = t^2$, so $t = \pm\sqrt{x}$. Then:
    \[ y = 2t - 1 = \pm 2\sqrt{x} - 1 \]
    Since the parameter $t$ ranges from $-2$ to $2$, we get both branches. However, note that $x \geq 0$ always (since $x = t^2$).
}

\Example{Sketch the parametric curve $x = \cos(t)$, $y = \sin(t)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$.}{
    This is the unit circle! At $t=0$, we're at $(1,0)$. At $t = \pi/2$, we're at $(0,1)$. At $t=\pi$, we're at $(-1,0)$. At $t = 3\pi/2$, we're at $(0,-1)$, and at $t=2\pi$ we return to $(1,0)$.
    To eliminate the parameter, use the Pythagorean identity:
    \[ x^2 + y^2 = \cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1 \]
    So the curve traces the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, starting at $(1,0)$ and moving counterclockwise.

\subsection{Arc Length with Parametric Equations}

The arc length of a curve is given by \[ 
    L = \int  \dd{s}
\] where,
\begin{align*}
    \dd{s} &= \sqrt{1 + \left( \dv{y}{x} \right)^2} \dd{x} \quad \text{ if } y = f(x), a \leq x \leq b \\
    \dd{s} &= \sqrt{1 + \left( \dv{x}{y} \right)^2} \dd{y} \quad \text{ if } x = h(y), c \leq y \leq d
\end{align*}

Using the first $\dd{s}$, we can write \[ 
    \dd{x} = \dv{x}{t} \dd{t}
\]
Then the arc length formula becomes,
\begin{align*}
    L &= \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{\dv{y}{t}}{\dv{x}{t}} \right)^2} \dv{x}{t} \dd{t} \\ 
      &= \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \frac{1}{\lvert \dv{x}{t} \rvert} \sqrt{\left( \dv{x}{t} \right)^2 + \left( \dv{y}{t} \right)^2} \dv{x}{t} \dd{t}
\end{align*}

        L = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{\left( \dv{x}{t} \right)^2 + \left( \dv{y}{t} \right)^2} \dd{t}

\subsection{Polar Coordinates}

In polar coordinates, each point is determined by a distance $r$ from the origin and an angle $\theta$ measured counterclockwise from the positive $x$-axis. This provides an alternative way to describe points in the plane.

\Note[Polar to Cartesian Conversion]{
    To convert from polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ to Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$:
    \[ 
        x = r \cos \theta \quad y = r \sin \theta
    \]
}

\Note[Cartesian to Polar Conversion]{
    To convert from Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$:
    \begin{align*}
        r^2 &= x^2 + y^2 &&\tan\theta = \frac{y}{x} \\
        r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} &&\theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{x} \right)
    \end{align*}
    Note: The formula for $\theta$ requires care with quadrants. The functions $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$ and $\tan\theta = y/x$ are the fundamental relationships.

\subsection{Tangents with Polar Coordinates}

To find $\dv{y}{x}$ for a polar curve $r = f(\theta)$, we use the parametric derivatives. Since $x = r\cos\theta$ and $y = r\sin\theta$, applying the product rule gives:
\[ 
    \dv{x}{\theta} = r' \cos \theta - r \sin \theta \quad \dv{y}{\theta} = r' \sin \theta + r \cos \theta
\]

\Note[Tangents with Polar Coordinates]{
    \[ 
        \dv{y}{x} = \frac{\dv{y}{\theta}}{\dv{x}{\theta}} = \frac{r' \sin \theta + r \cos \theta}{r' \cos \theta - r \sin \theta}
    \]
    where $r' = \dv{r}{\theta}$.

\Note[Area with Polar Coordinates]{
    For the area between two polar curves $r = r_o(\theta)$ (outer radius) and $r = r_i(\theta)$ (inner radius):
    \[ 
        A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \left( r_o^2 - r_i^2 \right) \dd{\theta}
    \]
    For the area enclosed by a single polar curve $r = f(\theta)$, set $r_i = 0$:
    \[ 
        A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} r^2 \dd{\theta}

Let \[ 
    r = f(\theta) \quad \alpha \leq \theta \leq \beta

\begin{align*}
    x &= r \cos(\theta) && y = r \sin(\theta) \\
    x &= f(\theta) \cos\theta && y = f(\theta) \sin\theta \\
    \dv{x}{\theta} &= \dv{r}{\theta}\cos\theta - r \sin\theta && \dv{y}{\theta} = \dv{r}{\theta}\sin\theta + r \cos\theta

Now,
\begin{align*}
    \left( \dv{x}{\theta} \right)^2 + \left( \dv{y}{\theta} \right)^2 &= \left( \dv{r}{\theta} \cos\theta - r \sin\theta \right)^2 + \left( \dv{r}{\theta} \sin\theta + r \cos\theta \right)^2 \\
